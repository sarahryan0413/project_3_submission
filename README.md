## Hello Earthling! üëΩ

This project is meant to showcase the number and type of reported incidents regarding Unidentifiable Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). In the past, these were commonly referred to as UFOs or Unidentified Flying Objects. The goal was to understand the frequency of reports by location and trends in data over time. The analysis generated discussion and theory on potential socio-economic causes behind the numbers, particularly when reporting spikes correlated to larger world events. The presence of more reports in certain parts of the world than others can also suggest cultural and environmental causes. The datasets go as far back as the 16th century! There are year-over-year and month-over month views as well as an interactive map showing the last 100 reports in the 2025 data to understand more recent reports. 

### Instructions on how to use and interact with the project:
The map will be the most informative part of this project where you can navigate around the world to see the last 100 reports that have been shared. For further research, there are graphs showing month-over-month and year-over-year data. It should be noted that any data points under year ‚Äú0‚Äù are old reports that do not have a verified date. No personally identifiable information was provided in the report. Only details regarding the general city and state, characteristics of the UAPs and the report type were included. Please use the associated drop down menus to explore the types of UAPs reported in each region, represented by a unique emoji icon. 

It is important to note that the further back in time the reports are made, the less frequently they are documented given technological limitations of that time. It would be wrong to assume based on these findings that there were truly fewer UAPs per say. Reports from the 1900s onward are more complete than ones before then. 

### Ethical considerations made in the project:
For this project, it was important to consider that not every report is credible or verifiable as to what the object ultimately was. We thought that it is ethical to engage in the socio-economic and philosophical questions that arise from theorizing about the origins and root causes for certain reports, but ultimately, we make no further claims about the veracity and credibility of the reports.
