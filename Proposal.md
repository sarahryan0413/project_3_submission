**Project Proposal:**   
Data Visualization of UFO Sightings from the National UFO Reporting Center Database

**Teammates:**   
Dina Rodrigues, Jameson McLendon, Kimarlee Tran, Quinton Stibbins, Sarah Ryan

**Project Summary:**   
Through web-scraping, exploratory analysis, and visualization, this project will seek to uncover trends in sighting frequency, geographic hotspots, seasonal and yearly patterns.

**Datasets:**

* Data for 03/2025: [https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202503](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202503)  
* Data for all: [https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=all](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=all)   
* From the **National UFO Reporting Center**

**Visual ideas:** 

* Bar chart \- comparing [sightings per month](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event)  
* Leaflet map \- have the shapes of UFO be the marker?  
* Pie chart \- distribution of country reporting  
* Line graph \- compare peaks in reporting by year  
* Heatmap \- to explore concentration of points (toggle on/off)

**Questions to explore:**

* What happened in the years where there were major jumps in sightings?  
  * Was there a jump when smartphones became accessible?  
    * July 2 \- world UFO day  
  * Was it a pause that allowed people to notice? Was it “a lack of oxygen”  
    * Religion vs. tech \- referencing Dina’s recollection  
* Is there a concentration of points on the map? Is there anything in that area that could potentially lead to people reporting UFOs?

**Hypothesis for further investigation (not explored in this project)**

* Further research on the overlap between world events and the physical and mental trauma caused could yield an overlap in rises in reports  
  * Covid also allowed for people to observe the world around them more and also there were reports of low oxygen causing hallucinations and paranoia.   
* Science based versus religious sightings, year over year.  
* Is there an overlap with surveillance activities? Protest/riots/political phobias  
* Public perception of unusual sights versus actual numbers  
  * Places like Area 51 are not really seen very often by the public other than the media, but the perception that there are a lot of strange activities is high due to the secrecy.
